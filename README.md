# Tic Tac Toe

This minimalistic version of Tic Tac Toe was created with the sole intention to try out C++ and get used to it. This mini-game makes use of pointers, classes and simple templates I created. It also tries to handle possible errors the user input could provoque. The code is also mostly refractored.

The `main` file was compiled on my personal laptop. Feel free to clone this repo and compile it yourself.
